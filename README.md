# ⚡ MeetupOS

**"We gather moments, not just people."**

MeetupOS is a real-time, mobile-first companion web application designed to gamify offline meetups. It replaces boring presentations with interactive games, live voting, and anonymous confessions, all controlled from a central Admin Dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

### For the Admin (RC/Host)

  * **Command Center:** A desktop-optimized dashboard to control the entire room.
  * **Live Player List:** See who is online in real-time.
  * **Moderation Tools:** "Kick" unwanted users or "Buzz" (vibrate) a student's phone to get attention.
  * **Game Control:** seamless switching between game modes.
  * **Question Manager:** Bulk upload Truths, Dares, and Trivia via JSON file.

### For Students (Mobile)

  * **No Login Required:** Automatic guest authentication (one device = one account).
  * **Real-Time Sync:** Screens update instantly when the Admin changes the game.
  * **Haptic Feedback:** Phones vibrate when buzzed or when it's their turn.
  * **Interactive UI:** Neo-brutalism design style for a fun, casual vibe.

### 🎮 The Games

1.  **RNG (Truth or Dare):**
      * Anti-repeat logic (remembers recent victims).
      * "The Tribunal": Trigger live Pass/Fail voting from the audience.
2.  **Over/Under (Tournament Mode):**
      * Best of 3 or 5 rounds.
      * Automated scoring and Grand Champion calculation.
3.  **Confessions:**
      * Themed prompts (e.g., "Hostel Horror Stories").
      * Admin curates and "Broadcasts" the best ones to everyone's screen.

## 📂 How to Add Questions (Bulk Upload)

You don't need to enter questions manually. Create a `data.json` file on your computer with this structure:

```json
{
  "truths": [
    "What is your biggest fear?",
    "Who is your crush?"
  ],
  "dares": [
    "Do 10 pushups.",
    "Dance like a chicken."
  ],
  "ou": [
    {"q": "How many stairs to library?", "a": "140"},
    {"q": "Age of IITK?", "a": "64"}
  ]
}
```

1.  Open the **Admin Dashboard** (Login with `1234`).
2.  Click **📂 Upload Questions**.
3.  Select your JSON file.
4.  Done\! The database is now seeded.
